# Remix-scrapping
Scraping data from remixshop.com

The project consists of 3 spiders:

product_spider - opens the main store page and scrapes all produc data, saving it in a CSV file

gather_urls - opens the main store page and scrapes all produc URLs saving them in a text file for later use

product_details - reads the file generated from the previous spider and scrapes data for each individual product
